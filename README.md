# livox_camera_calib
**livox_camera_calib** is a robust, high accuracy extrinsic calibration tool between high resolution LiDAR (e.g. Livox) and camera in targetless environment. Our algorithm can run in both indoor and outdoor scenes, and only requires edge information in the scene. If the scene is suitable, we can achieve pixel-level accuracy similar to or even beyond the target based method.

    <font color=#a0a0a0 size=2>An example of a outdoor calibration scenario. We color the point cloud with the calibrated extrinsic and compare with actual image. A and C are locally enlarged
views of the point cloud. B and D are parts of the camera image
corresponding to point cloud in A and C.</font>

Source code will be released soon.
